# SalesReporting README #

This repository is being created _"to cut down the mightiest tree in the forest withâ€¦a herring!"_
Also to report sales at work - win/win. 

Most of what I do at work right now is manipulate Excel data into dynamic reports that update once new data is added. I have to export at least three files daily from our software and save as a particular file that will update all my other reports.

My latest task is creating a cumulative commission report for our salespeople, and I would love for this to be a stepping stone to creating that and learning more advanced ways of handling data.

Here are the links that are helping me get to where I'm trying to go:

 * Had a lot of trouble getting started with this, as usual. I'm hoping it's not too simple for the project or too complicated for me.
 * Having a lot of trouble with dates. Asked team in Microsoft Teams.
