# SalesReporting README #

This repository is being created _"to cut down the mightiest tree in the forest withâ€¦a herring!"_
Also to report sales at work - win/win.

Here are the links that are helping me get to where I'm trying to go:

 * [GitHub - Introduction to Python CSV](https://github.com/slott56/introduction-python-csv)
 * [Protechtraining.com](https://www.protechtraining.com/blog/post/python-for-beginners-reading-manipulating-csv-files-737)
 * [GitHub - Manipulating CSV Files Using Python C and Shell Script](https://github.com/mossydidar/Manipulating-CSV-files-using-Python-C-and-Shell-Script)

 :notes: Notes :notes:

 Had a lot of trouble getting started with this, as usual.
 I'm hoping it's not too simple for the project or too complicated for me.
